## 💬 What is OmniTrade?

OmniTrade is an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that lets you trade cryptocurrency using natural language through Claude. No more juggling exchange dashboards — just tell Claude what you want:

```
You: "What's my portfolio worth?"
Claude: Your portfolio across 2 exchanges is worth $12,456.78
        
        Binance: $8,234.56
        └── 0.15 BTC ($6,322.50)
        └── 2.5 ETH ($1,912.06)
        
        Coinbase: $4,222.22
        └── 100 SOL ($4,222.22)
```

```
You: "Buy $100 of ETH on the cheapest exchange"  
Claude: I found the best price for ETH:
        • Kraken: $765.20 (cheapest)
        • Binance: $765.89 (+0.09%)
        • Coinbase: $766.12 (+0.12%)
        
        ✅ Bought 0.1306 ETH on Kraken for $100.00
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g omnitrade-mcp
```

### 2. Run the Setup Wizard

```bash
omnitrade setup
```

The interactive wizard walks you through everything in ~2 minutes:

- 🔑 Add your exchange API keys (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and more)
- 🔒 Configure security settings (order size limits, allowed pairs, testnet mode)
- 🖥️ Auto-configure **Claude Desktop** — writes to your config file automatically
- 💻 Optionally auto-configure **Claude Code** (terminal) — writes to `~/.claude/settings.json`

That's it. No manual JSON editing required.

### 3. Start Trading

Restart Claude Desktop (or reload Claude Code) and start chatting:

- *"What's my balance on Binance?"*
- *"Show me ETH prices across all exchanges"*
- *"Buy $50 of BTC on the cheapest exchange"*
- *"Are there any arbitrage opportunities?"*

<br />

## ⚙️ Manual Configuration

Prefer to configure manually? Add OmniTrade to your Claude config:

### Claude Desktop

<details>
<summary><b>macOS</b> — <code>~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json</code></summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omnitrade": {
      "command": "omnitrade",
      "args": ["start"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windows</b> — <code>%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json</code></summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omnitrade": {
      "command": "omnitrade",
      "args": ["start"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### Claude Code (Terminal)

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omnitrade": {
      "command": "omnitrade",
      "args": ["start"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then run `claude` in your terminal and OmniTrade will be available.

## 🖥️ TUI Dashboard

Launch a full-screen Bloomberg Terminal-style interface directly in your terminal — live prices, charts, and your portfolio panel updating in real time.

```bash
omnitrade dashboard
```

The dashboard opens in full-screen and shows:

- **Live price ticker** — Watchlist of your configured pairs, updating every few seconds
- **Price chart panel** — Interactive candlestick chart for the selected pair (1h, 4h, 24h, 7d)
- **Portfolio panel** — Current holdings and real-time P&L across all connected exchanges

**Keyboard shortcuts:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate the watchlist |
| `1` `4` `D` `W` | Switch chart timeframe (1h / 4h / 24h / 7d) |
| `Tab` | Cycle between panels |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Exit dashboard |

The dashboard reads from the same `~/.omnitrade/config.json` as the MCP server — no extra setup required.

<br />

## 📝 Paper Trading

Practice risk-free with a virtual wallet before committing real funds. Paper trading uses **live market prices** from your connected exchanges, so your results reflect what would actually happen.

**Starting balance:** $10,000 USDT

```bash
# Buy in paper mode
omnitrade paper buy BTC 0.01

# Sell in paper mode
omnitrade paper sell ETH 0.5

# View your virtual portfolio
omnitrade paper portfolio

# Review trade history
omnitrade paper history

# Reset back to $10,000 USDT
omnitrade paper reset
```

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `omnitrade paper buy <ASSET> <AMOUNT>` | Buy at current live price, deducting from virtual USDT balance |
| `omnitrade paper sell <ASSET> <AMOUNT>` | Sell at current live price, crediting virtual USDT balance |
| `omnitrade paper portfolio` | Show all virtual holdings with live valuations and P&L |
| `omnitrade paper history` | View the full list of paper trades with timestamps and prices |
| `omnitrade paper reset` | Wipe trade history and reset balance to $10,000 USDT |

Paper trading state is stored locally in `~/.omnitrade/paper.json` — separate from your live trading config. It has no impact on real orders.

<br />

## 🖥 CLI Commands

OmniTrade ships with a standalone CLI for setup, monitoring, and background operation — separate from the MCP server that Claude uses.

### Daemon — Background Price Monitoring

The daemon runs in the background and fires notifications when your price alerts trigger, even when Claude isn't open.

```bash
# Start the background daemon
omnitrade daemon start

# Check if the daemon is running (shows PID, uptime, recent log)
omnitrade daemon status

# Stop the daemon
omnitrade daemon stop
```

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `omnitrade daemon start` | Spawns the daemon as a detached background process. Writes a PID file to `~/.omnitrade/daemon.pid`. Logs to `~/.omnitrade/daemon.log`. |
| `omnitrade daemon status` | Shows whether the daemon is running, its PID, uptime, and the last 5 lines of the activity log. |
| `omnitrade daemon stop` | Sends SIGTERM to the daemon for a clean shutdown (waits up to 5s, then force-kills if needed). |

The daemon poll interval defaults to **60 seconds** and is configurable in `~/.omnitrade/config.json`:

```json
{
  "daemon": {
    "pollInterval": 30
  }
}
```

### Watch — Live Terminal Price Ticker

Stream live prices for one or more assets directly in your terminal. Updates every 5 seconds.

```bash
# Watch a single asset (defaults to USDT pair)
omnitrade watch BTC

# Watch multiple assets simultaneously
omnitrade watch BTC ETH SOL

# Watch full trading pairs
omnitrade watch BTC/USDT ETH/BTC SOL/ETH
```

The ticker auto-detects your configured exchange (falls back to public Binance data if no config exists). Each row shows the current price, direction indicator (▲ / ▼), and the change since the previous poll. If a symbol is **invalid or not available** on the exchange, the row is displayed in red with `⚠ INVALID` — it will never silently show `$0.00`.

Press **Ctrl+C** to exit the watch view cleanly.

### Setup — Interactive Configuration Wizard

Configure everything in ~2 minutes with the interactive setup wizard.

```bash
omnitrade setup
```

The wizard walks you through:

1. **Exchange API keys** — Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and 104+ more
2. **Security settings** — order size limits, allowed pairs, testnet mode
3. **Notification channels** — choose how to receive price alerts:

| Channel | How to configure |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Native OS** | Zero setup — uses system notifications on macOS, Windows, and Linux |
| **Telegram** | Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), get your token + chat ID |
| **Discord** | Create a webhook in your server's channel settings, paste the URL |

4. **Claude integration** — auto-writes to Claude Desktop config and optionally `~/.claude/settings.json` for Claude Code

You can re-run `omnitrade setup` at any time to update credentials or add new notification channels.

### Dashboard — Full-Screen TUI *(v0.9.0)*

Launch the Bloomberg Terminal-style interface with live prices, charts, and portfolio panel.

```bash
omnitrade dashboard
```

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `omnitrade dashboard` | Opens the full-screen TUI. Press `q` or `Ctrl+C` to exit. No arguments required — reads your existing config. |

### Paper — Risk-Free Practice Trading *(v0.9.0)*

Trade against live prices using a virtual $10,000 USDT wallet. State persists between sessions.

```bash
# Buy and sell with virtual funds
omnitrade paper buy BTC 0.01
omnitrade paper sell ETH 0.5

# Review your positions and history
omnitrade paper portfolio
omnitrade paper history

# Start fresh
omnitrade paper reset
```

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `omnitrade paper buy <ASSET> <AMOUNT>` | Buy at the current live price. Deducts USDT from virtual wallet. |
| `omnitrade paper sell <ASSET> <AMOUNT>` | Sell at the current live price. Credits USDT to virtual wallet. |
| `omnitrade paper portfolio` | Show all virtual holdings with live valuations and total P&L. |
| `omnitrade paper history` | List every paper trade with timestamp, price, and value at execution. |
| `omnitrade paper reset` | Reset virtual wallet to $10,000 USDT and clear trade history. |

### API Key Best Practices

<table>
<tr>
<td>

**✅ Always**
- Enable only View + Trade permissions
- Use IP restrictions when available
- Use testnet for testing first
- Set `chmod 600` on config file
